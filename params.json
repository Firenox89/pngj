No dependencies on third party libraries, nor even on `java.awt.*` or `javax.imageio.*`\r\n* Runs on  __Android__ and __GAE__ (Google App Engine) \r\n* Allows to read and write progressively, row by row. This means that you can process huge images without needing to load them fully in memory.\r\n* Reads and writes all PNG color models. Interlaced PNG is supported (though not welcomed) for reading.\r\n* Full support for __metadata__ handling (\"chunks\").\r\n* The format of the pixel data (for read and write) is extensible and very efficient (no double copies).\r\n* Supports asyncronous reading and low level tweaking and extension in the reader.\r\n* Basic support for APNG reading\r\n* Open source (Apache licence). Available in Maven Central repository.\r\n\r\n## What is this for?\r\n\r\nThis is a relatively low level library, its goal is to code and decode PNG images from/to raw pixels, optimizing memory usage and speed.\r\nIt does not provide any high-level image processing (eg, resizing, colour conversions), it does not try to abstract the concrete PNG color model (as `BufferedImage` does, for example). \r\nIn particular, the default format of the scanlines (as wrapped in `ImageLineInt` or `ImageLineByte`) is not abstract, the meaning of the values depends on the image color model and bitdepth.\r\n\r\n## More documentation\r\n\r\nPending\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
